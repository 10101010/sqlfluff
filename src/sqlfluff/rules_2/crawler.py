""" implements the base crawler which all the rules are based on """

# Crawlers, crawl through the trees returned by the parser and
# evaluate particular rules.
# The intent is that it should be possible for the rules to be epxressed
# as simply as possible, with as much of the complexity abstracted away.

# The evaluation function should take enough arguments that it can evaluate
# the position of the given segment in relation to it's neighbors, and that
# the segment which finally "triggers" the error, should be the one that would
# be corrected OR if the rule relates to something that is missing, then it
# should flag on the segment FOLLOWING, the place that the desired element is
# missing.
