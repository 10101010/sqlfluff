# TODO Notes


probably write some tests around identifier matching


the basic sql statement is ALMOST there, maybe simplify the grammar a bit before making it more complicated again.


Seperate out the matchResult class into a seperate module

## Notes

### Development (Now)
- deal with joins
- clear out the old code from parser_2 before trying to integrate
### Development (Next)
- integrate with linting
- deal with the infinite loop on the multi statement test
- Implement config parsing from comment segments
### Pre Deployment
- Remove the TODO file or at least make this tidy before go-live
- Make a note about changes and limitations in the readme
