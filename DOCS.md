# SqlFluff

## The SQL Linter for humans

# Documentation

## General Parameters

Most SQLfluff commands implement a few common parameters, rather than documenting
them on each command, they are documented here for brevity:

- `[-v, --verbose]`: Verbosity, how detailed should the output be.
- `[-n, --nocolor]`: No color - if this is set then the output will be
  without ANSI color codes.
- `[--dialect ansi]`: Which dialect to run sqlfluff with, defaulting
  to `ansi`. Options
  - `ansi` - Currently the only option - assumes that the sql is in
    line with [_ISO/IEC 9075_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9075)
  - ... to come `mysql`, `redshift` and potentially others...
- `[--rules RULES]`: Narrow the search to only specific rules. For example
  specifying `--rules L001` will only search for rule `L001` (Unnessesary
  trailing whitespace). Multiple rules can be specified with commas e.g.
  `--rules L001,L002` will specify only looking for violations of rule
  `L001` and rule `L002`.
- `[--exclude-rules RULES]`: Exclude specific rules. For example
  specifying `--exclude-rules L001` will remove rule `L001` (Unnessesary
  trailing whitespace) from the set of considered rules. This could either
  be the whitelist, or the general set if there is no specific whitelist.
  Multiple rules can be specified with commas e.g.
  `--exclude-rules L001,L002` will exclude violations of rule
  `L001` and rule `L002`.

## `sqlfluff version`

**Purpose:** Read out the current version information of sqlfluff.

**Usage:** `sqlfluff version [-v, --verbose] [-n, --nocolor] [--dialect ansi] [--rules RULES] [--exclude-rules RULES]`

**Example responses:**

> _Not verbose:_
>
> ```shell
> $ sqlfluff version
> 0.0.4
> ```

> _Verbose:_
>
> ```shell
> $ sqlfluff version -v
> sqlfluff:      0.0.4 python:        3.6.7
> ```

## `sqlfluff lint`

**Purpose:** Actually lint things.

**Usage:** `sqlfluff lint [-v, --verbose] [-n, --nocolor] [--dialect ansi] [--rules RULES] [--exclude-rules RULES] [PATH]`

**Parameters:**

- `[PATH]` the path to a sql file or directory to lint.
  - _Files_ e.g. `test_file.sql` or `src/some_other_file.sql` - passing
    the path of a single file just lints a single file.
  - _Directories_ e.g. `src` or `~/dev/my_project` - pass a directory path
    searches through that directory for `.sql` files and lints all the
    files it finds.
  - _Blank_. If you just call `sqlfluff lint` without a path specified
    if will be as though you passed the current working directory and
    will behave as per the above command.
  - _Stdin_. A lone `-` character will tell `sqlfluff` to lint data passed via stdin.


**Example responses:**

_NB: Examples of the `--nocolor` option not shown as the textual output is the same, just with different colors_

> _Not verbose:_
>
> ```shell
> $ sqlfluff lint test.sql
> == [test.sql] FAIL
> L:   1 | P:   1 | L003 | Single indentation uses a number of spaces not a multiple of 4
> L:   1 | P:  14 | L006 | Operators should be surrounded by a single space unless at the start/end of a line
> L:   1 | P:  27 | L001 | Unnecessary trailing whitespace
> ```

> _Verbose (with dialect):_
>
> ```shell
> $ sqlfluff lint test.sql -v  --dialect ansi
> ==== sqlfluff ====
> sqlfluff:      0.0.4 python:        3.6.7
> dialect:        ansi verbosity:         1

> L:   1 | P:  14 | L006 | Operators should be surrounded by a single space unless at the start/end of a line
> L:   1 | P:  27 | L001 | Unnecessary trailing whitespace
> ==== summary ====
> violations:        3 status:         FAIL
> ```

> _Very Verbose:_
>
> ```shell
> $ sqlfluff lint test.sql -vv
> ==== sqlfluff ====
> sqlfluff:      0.0.4 python:        3.6.7
> dialect:        ansi verbosity:         2
> ==== readout ====
> === [ path: test.sql ] ===
> == [test.sql] FAIL
> L:   1 | P:   1 | L003 | Single indentation uses a number of spaces not a multiple of 4
> L:   1 | P:  14 | L006 | Operators should be surrounded by a single space unless at the start/end of a line
> L:   1 | P:  27 | L001 | Unnecessary trailing whitespace
> ==== summary ====
> files:             1 violations:        3
> clean files:       0 unclean files:     1
> avg per file:   3.00 status:         FAIL
> ```

## `sqlfluff rules`

**Purpose:** Display the current available rules.

**Usage:** `sqlfluff rules [-v, --verbose] [-n, --nocolor] [--dialect ansi] [--rules RULES] [--exclude-rules RULES]`

**Example responses:**

> _Limited:_
>
> ```shell
> $ sqlfluff rules --rules L001
> ==== sqlfluff - rules ====
> L001: Unnecessary trailing whitespace
> ```

> _Unlimited:_
>
> ```shell
> $ sqlfluff rules
> ==== sqlfluff - rules ====
> L001: Unnecessary trailing whitespace
> L002: Single indentation uses mixture of tabs and spaces
> L003: Single indentation uses a number of spaces not a multiple of 4
> ...
> ```

## `sqlfluff fix`

**Purpose:** Autofix linting errors.

> This command will make widespread changes to your SQL codebase. Use with
> caution, and in particular I would **VERY STRONGLY RECOMMEND** only using
> the tool on a codebase which uses version control (e.g. Git) so that you
> can easily roll back any changes made.

**Usage:** `sqlfluff fix [-v, --verbose] [-n, --nocolor] [--dialect ansi] [--rules RULES] [--exclude-rules RULES] [-f, --force] [PATH]`

**Parameters:**

- **NB:** The `rules` option is compulsory for fixing errors (you can still
  specify mutiple linting rules if you wish however). This is for your own
  safety!
- `[-f, --force]` - skip the confirmation prompt and go straight to applying
  fixes. **Use this with caution.**
- `[PATH]` - Exactly the same implementation as `sqlfluff lint`.
